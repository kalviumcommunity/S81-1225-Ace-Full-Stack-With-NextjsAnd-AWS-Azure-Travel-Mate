# Screenshot Evidence

Add real PR screenshots here to back up the workflow documentation.

Recommended naming:
- `pr-checks.png` – Successful pipeline + approvals
- `review-comments.png` – Example of resolved discussion

Once added, embed the images inside the root `README.md` using Markdown:

```markdown
![Checks passing](docs/screenshots/pr-checks.png)
```
